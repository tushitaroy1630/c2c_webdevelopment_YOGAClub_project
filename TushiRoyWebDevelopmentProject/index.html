        <u>Yoga</u> is an ancient and complex practice, rooted in Indian Philosopy.Yoga as exercise is a physical
        activity consisting mainly of postures, often connected by flowing sequences, sometimes accompanied by breathing
        exercises, and frequently ending with relaxation lying down or meditation. Yoga in this form has become familiar
        across the world, especially in the US and Europe. It is derived from medieval Haá¹­ha yoga, which made use of
        similar postures, but it is generally simply called "yoga". Academics have given yoga as exercise a variety of
        names, including modern postural yoga and transnational anglophone yoga
